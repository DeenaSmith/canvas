Canvas is an application for tattoo artist's that allows users (artists) to save images that inspire them for future use. The app utilizes React, GraphQL, MongoDB, Bootstrap, and Apollo to give the users a seamless experience. Future functionality includes the ability for users to signup and search for specific art styles that will lead to their desired artist and adding more artist-friendly functionality.
